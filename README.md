YONA is a payment orchestration layer for virtual (crypto, digital) asset service providers (VASPs) and KYC verified self-hosted wallets. We are not a money-transmitter, bank, custodian, or wallet-service provider. Instead, we offer a universal medium for users of varying wallet types and providers to connect for low-cost, compliant virtual asset transfers.
