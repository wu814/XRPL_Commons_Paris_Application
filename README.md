# YONA LLC

**YONA** is a payment orchestration layer for virtual (crypto, digital) asset service providers (VASPs) and KYC verified self-hosted wallets. 

> **Note:** We are not a money-transmitter, bank, custodian, or wallet provider. Instead, we offer a universal medium for users of varying wallet types and providers to connect for low-cost, compliant virtual asset transfers.

This repo has been shortened for the application to provide a simple overview of the systems architecture and non-proprietary logic. If additional review is needed, we can provide the extended repo.
